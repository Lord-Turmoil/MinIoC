## 1. Overview

Since everything is implemented with C++ template, so there are only header files located under `mioc/include` directory. And a test file `Test.cpp` is placed under `src/` directory as an example.

This container provides two object lifetime - singleton and transient. Singleton object will be created on adding, and no more instances will be created later. While transient object will be constructed every time it is resolved.

To avoid pointer problems, I use `std::shared_ptr` to wrap all native pointers. ðŸ™‚

## 2. Usage

### 2.1 Test Classes

Here are the classes we use in this demonstration. Interfaces are omitted as they are really simple. We can see that, B depends on A, and C depends on B.

```cpp
class A : public IA
{
public:
    A() = default;
};

class B : public IB
{
public:
    B(std::shared_ptr<IA> a) :_a(std::move(a)) {}
private:
    std::shared_ptr<IA> _a;
};

class C : public IC
{
public:
    C(std::shared_ptr<IB> b) : _b(std::move(b)) {}
private:
    std::shared_ptr<IB> _b;
};
```

### 2.2 Create Container

You can create a container using `ServiceContainer::New()`. In this case, you have to inject this container everywhere you need.

```c++
#include "ServiceContainer.h"
mioc::ServiceContainerPtr container = mioc::ServiceContainer::New();
```

Or, you can use `SingletonContainer` which provides you a global scale singleton container. This container will not be created until the first time you get it.

```c++
#include "SingletonContainer.h"
mioc::ServiceContainerPtr container = mioc::SingletonContainer::GetContainer();
```

### 2.3 Add Singleton

First, is to use type name only. You should provide its interface type, and concrete type. And all dependency types if it has.

```cpp
container->AddSingleton<IA, A>();      // without dependency
container->AddSingleton<IB, B, IA>();  // with dependencies
```

Also, you can directly add a pre-constructed instance to it. This way, you may need a pointer conversion first, which convert concrete type to its corresponding interface. You don't need to pass type name in this case.

```c++
std::shared_ptr<IC> c = std::make_shared<C>(b);
container->AddSingleton(c);
```

### 2.4 Add Transient

It is simpler to add a transient object. We just need to pass type names, and they will be properly resolved later.

```c++
container->AddTransient<IA, A>();
container->AddTransient<IB, B, IA>();
container->AddTransient<IC, C, IB>();
```

### 2.5 Resolve Instances

No matter which way you use to add objects into the container, you can always resolve a instance with the interface type you provided on adding. `nullptr` will be returned if the interface is not registered.

```c++
std::shared_ptr<IC> c = container->Resolve<IC>();
```

## 3. Limitations

Though this mini IoC container can handle dependency injection, you have to manually specify all dependencies a instance needs.

Also, it does not support lazy initialization yet, which means all instances are created on registration. ðŸ¥²
